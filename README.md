# Personal-Portfolio-Website


This is my personal portfolio website. 
It consists of a total of 6 pages which include:-<br>
1.) Homepage - It includes my basic introduction and a picture of mine.<br>
2.) About-Me page - A single word which describes me and some information about my general interest and hobbies.<br>
3.) Projects - This page contains 2 galleries- one which shows all of my self-made artworks and the other which displays my web projects.<br>
4.) Artwork gallery - A very special page which displays several of my hand-made paintings.<br>
5.) Web-projects - This page displays glimpses from my previously developed website.<br>
6.) Contact-me page - The page provides with a platform through which people can reach out to me through gmail,linkedin or simply through the website provided message box.<br><br>
It is a very basic portfolio website which I would like to improve upon. <br>
Any suggestions and criticism is welcomed :)
